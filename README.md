### Welcome!

I developed a machine learning projects that **predict diabetes** using health data from people who have lived in **Pima Arizona**. I used the **Random Forest Classification** method in this project

One of the **most important** issues here is that all our patients are **at least 21 years old** to prevent diabetes that will occur at a young age.

*I shared the data set with the code. You can use it as you wish.*

### Attributes (columns):

- **Pregnancies:**  Number of times pregnant
- **Glucose:**  Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
- **BloodPressure:**  Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
- **SkinThickness:**  Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
- **Insulin:**  2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
- **BMI**  Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
- **DiabetesPedigreeFunction:**  Diabetes pedigree function
- **Age:**  Age (years)
- **Outcome:**  Class variable (0 or 1)

*The target label indicates whether the patient has been diagnosed with diabetes (1) or not (0).*
